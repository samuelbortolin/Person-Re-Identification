# Attributes classification and Person Re-Identification
Implementation of a convolutional neural network for person re-identification and attribute classification tasks, written in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).
The CNN has been trained on [Market-1501](https://github.com/vana77/Market-1501_Attribute) Dataset.

The source code file is a Python notebook and can be executed with Jupyter or Google Colab.
Documentation and description of the code is present in the notebook.

## Requirements
Python3 is required with the following dependencies installed:
* PyTorch
* Torchvision
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Scikit-image

All the required packages are already installed on Google Colab.

It is recommended the use of a GPU that supports CUDA framework.

## Usage
Open the notebook file with Colab or Jupyter and run all the code.
